        <h3>About me</h3>
        <h4>I am currently in my second year of Software Engineering at the University of Western Ontario, with an anticipated graduation date in the class of 2026. My academic journey has been an exciting blend of logic, innovation, and problem-solving. In the world of software engineering, I've discovered a profound love for transforming lines of code into functional and elegant solutions. I have been a national synchronized swimmer for 10 years having taken my first year off last year but am planning on getting right back in the pool for this season! In recent years I have also started to coach artistic swimming. After many years in the pool I decided it was time to give back to such an amazing community and start coaching the younger generation and help them reach their goals and aspirations. I also love baking, reading, and spending time with my friends and family to calm down and de stress! </h4>
